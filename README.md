Asteroids-Game
==============
This game is called asteroids. You are the spaceship and you move around using the arrow keys. You shoot with the spacekey
at the asteroids that move around. If you run into an asteroid, you lose. Also, if you press the / key, you use one of five special moves. Special moves make bursts of lasers come out of your spaceship. This is using python and it took me four days to finish.
